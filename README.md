# Titanic_Data_Analysis

Description:
This repository contains my Titanic dataset analysis project. As a Data Analyst, I've explored this classic dataset to enhance my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Key Features:
1. Data Wrangling: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering (creating new columns such as family size).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset using visualizations like histograms, pair plots, and scatter plots to uncover patterns and trends in survival based on variables such as age, fare, and passenger class.
3. Statistical Insights: Basic statistics like mean, median, and mode of numerical data to understand the distribution of the dataset.
4. Visualizations: Plotting survival rates, passenger demographics, and other key features using seaborn and matplotlib.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.

Files in the Repository:
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the full code for data analysis, including data wrangling and visualizations.
Dataset: The Titanic dataset used in this project (can be loaded via seaborn).
